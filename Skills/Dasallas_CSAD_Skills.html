			<p><blockquote>
				Growing up, I discovered certain strengths in my personality that I can consider as my skill. 
				The soft skills I have are creativity, hardworking, and attention to detail. 
				I consider myself a creative person. I like to think of imaginative ways and apply them to the things I make. 
				I am a hardworking person because I persevere and put effort into the things I love to do. 
				Also, I always focus on details so I can create and deliver my work to its best version. 
				Moreover, some of the hard skills I have are video editing, photo-color grading, and programming.
				In high school, I studied video editing by watching youtube tutorials. 
				I got commissions and earned money back then from editing video projects of my schoolmates and doing coding assignments.

			<h4 class="pTitle">HOBBIES.</h4>
			<img src="hobbies.png" class="icon">
			<p><blockquote>
				Listening to music is one of the hobbies I love to do. 
				It isolates me from the crowd, especially when my social battery runs out. 
				It also helps me to improve my emotions. When I'm happy I listen to music. 
				When I'm sad I listen to music. When I'm bored I listen to music. 
				I also like to watch movies and series in my leisure time. 
				I find them entertaining and relaxing. The genres I  watch are sitcoms, science fiction, and documentaries. 
				In addition, I like to play video games. It distracts me but makes me stressed at the same time.
				The most common games that I play are League of Legends and Valorant. I play them because they are free and most of my friends use it.

			<h4 class="pTitle">INTERESTS.</h4>
			<img src="interest.png" class="icon">
			<p><blockquote>
				I am fond of video editing and programming. 
				The idea of creating something from raw material through editing, and connecting notions into a creative composition really pique my interest. 
				It's like a puzzle to me, figuring out how a concept works and applying it to the in-progress result. 
				I feel euphoric when I'm working on a project related to these aspects. I like to build something by applying the use of coding or video editing. 
				I am also interested in photography and color coding. It is amazing looking at peculiar photos. 
				I appreciate them especially nostalgic and nature photography. I study photography through youtube video tutorials, also on Instagram, and Twitter. 
				I take photos of my surroundings using my phone and color code them in the Adobe Lightroom mobile app.
