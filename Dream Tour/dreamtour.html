					<p id="clearR">The Town of Banff was the first town in Canada to be 
					incorporated inside a national park when it did so in 1990. 
					Banff and Lake Louise, which are home to renowned mountain ranges, 
					provide countless possibilities to experience the breathtaking beauty 
					all year long. Discovering the special magic of the Canadian Rockies 
					is made possible by the region's sparkling emerald lakes, breathtaking 
					snow-capped peaks, and innumerable picturesque vantage points. </p>

					<h2>Brief Description</h2><br>
					<p id="clearL">	Iceland is a land of numerous wonders, known as the "land of ice and fire."

					<h2>People & Culture</h2><br>
					
					<p id="clearR">Due the country's small area, family is very important 
					in Iceland. Icelandic families are frequently bigger than those in 
					other nations in Northern Europe. Although members of the extended 
					family don't typically reside together, grandparents, uncles, and aunts 
					frequently assist with child care. Since most individuals in Iceland have 
					lived there for a very long time, many Icelanders enjoy researching their ancestry.<br><br><br>

					In Icelandic culture and custom, everyone in the family participates in household chores. 
					Icelandic adolescents are raised to be independent, and as such, they are required 
					to clean their own bedrooms, change their own linens, vacuum or wash their floors, 
					do their own washing, cook their own meals, and clean their kitchens after every usage.</p>

					<h2>Brief Description</h2><br>
					<p id="clearR">Norway is a small nation located in northern Europe. 
					The famed fjords, which are marine inlets tucked between 
					high cliffs, are found along Norway's coastline. 
					These fjords and mountains are sculpted out by glaciers 
					that are breathtaking to look at. </p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="div">
					<img src="Images/norway-people.webp" id="left">
					<h2>People & Culture</h2><br>
					
					<p id="clearL">Norwegians take great pride in their democratic and humane values.
					The nation frequently accepts refugees and asylum seekers from other 
					nations. Norway's citizens enjoy one of the greatest standards of living 
					in the entire globe. Typically, businesses open at 8 a.m. Till 2 p.m., 
					with a 15-minute lunch break. Both parents are eligible for 42 
					weeks of paid leave when a child is born. The official start date for school 
					in Norway is seven years old (National Geographic, n.d.).

					<h2>Best Places to Visit</h2><br>

					<h2>Brief Description</h2><br>
					<p id="clearR">Ireland sits off of the northern coast of 
					continental Europe and West of Great Britain. It is referred
					to as the Emerald Isle due to its wide swaths of beautiful, green fields. 
					There also exist huge stretches of rocky, uneven terrain, and amazing rock 
					formations across this country. </p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="div">
					<a href="Images/ireland-people.jpg"><img src="Images/ireland-people.jpg" id="left"></a>
					<h2>People & Culture</h2><br>
					
					<p id="clearL">Ireland is a country of storytellers. The custom originated with
					Celtic bards who used to write down and recite the nation's history. Irish culture 
					is fascinating, varied, and a joy to learn about. Myths, literature, 
					music, dancing, art, gastronomy, and language are all part of it. The 
					culture was once only Gaelic, but it later absorbed elements from the 
					English, Tudor English, Scots, Normans, and Vikings.

					<h2>Best Places to Visit</h2><br>
					<p id="clearR"> One of my dream destinations here is the Cliffs of Moher. 
					For years, its natural beauty has captivated scientists, geologists, 
					painters, musicians, and poets who have been lured by the cliff’s 
					distinctive landscape. In this terrain, you can see the mesmerizing 
					view of the Aran Islands, as well as the calming view, and at the same 
					time chaotic waves of the Atlantic Ocean.</p><br>

						<h3>Rock of Cashel</h3><br>
						<p id="clearL">The Rock, rising high above the Golden Vale, 
						is home to an intriguing collection of ancient religious 
						artifacts. According to mythology, the Rock of Cashel 
						originally gained political importance in the fourth or

						stronghold and formed a line of kings-cum-bishops who ruled 
						over this region of Munster.</p>

						<h3>Killarney National Park</h3><br>
						<p id="clearL">Killarney is another remarkable place in Ireland.
						The lakeshores are covered in untouched woodland, including oak, 
						yew, and Mediterranean flora like the arbutus, also known as the 
						strawberry tree because of its bright red but poisonous berries. 
						The sole wild herd of red deer in Ireland, as well as otter, 
						pine marten, red squirrels, and Irish hare, are significant 
						creatures found in the park. One of the best things to do in 
						Ireland is to visit Killarney.</p>
